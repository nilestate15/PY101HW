#Week 2 HW1 (.py files are in my repo https://github.com/nilestate15/PY101HW)
#Niles Tate

#Problem 1 (file in repo)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Problem 2
#You should have a .gitignore file for others who may build onto your project
#so they know the following files should be ignored.  Prevents compiled byte
#code out of version control.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Problem 3 (separate .py file in repo)
#Input function
def MK_choose(characters):
    #Number of inputs
    fighters = 2
    #opens file and writes to it
    o = open(characters, "w")
    for i in range(fighters):
        p1_choose = input("Please choose character")
        #enters users input into file
        o.write(p1_choose + "\n")
    o.close()
#Append function
def MK_chosen(characters):
    #opens file to add new text
    o = open(characters, "a")
    #adds this string to file
    o.write("Characters chosen" + "\n")
    o.close()
#Module being run standalone by user
if __name__ == "__main__":
    characters = "MKcharacters.txt"
    #Call functions
    MK_choose(characters)
    MK_chosen(characters)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Problem 4 (same as 3 but using with function/separate .py file in repo)
def MK_choose(characters):
    #Number of inputs
    fighters = 2
    #opens file and writes to it
    with open(characters, "w") as o:
        for i in range(fighters):
            p1_choose = input("Please choose character")
            #enters users input into file
            o.write(p1_choose + "\n")
        o.close()
#Append function
def MK_chosen(characters):
    #opens file to add new text
    with open(characters, "a") as o:
        #adds this string to file
        o.write("Characters chosen" + "\n")
        o.close()
#Module being run standalone by user
if __name__ == "__main__":
    characters = "MKcharacters.txt"
    #Call functions
    MK_choose(characters)
    MK_chosen(characters)
